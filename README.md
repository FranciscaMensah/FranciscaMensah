Hi, I'm @FranciscaMensah an IT student at the University of Professional Studies, Accra. 

I am interested in UI/UX design, front-end web development and graphics design. 
I'm currently learning to use Figma and Photoshop in addition to HTML, CSS and Javascript to enhance my design skills. 

I look forward to collaborating with friends to create innovative solutions for businesses.
